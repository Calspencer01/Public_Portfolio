Wine preferences vary between consumers because of inherent differences in the human brain and palate. In this research, we aim to generate a regression model that can predict how a consumer will grade a wine based on physicochemical characteristics of the wine. While some of these properties have more importance to consumersâ€™ ratings than others, it is difficult to derive a model that can accurately predict wine ratings using multivariate analysis. Despite this difficulty, there is a distinct difference between the prediction accuracy on red wines versus white wines. It is clear that more research and experimentation should be done before deploying an algorithm like this to the industrial world, with which its impacts will be commensurate with its accuracy.
