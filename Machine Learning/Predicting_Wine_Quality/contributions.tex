E.E. wrote the abstract, introduction, experiments, and results sections. C.S. wrote the data preparation, broader impacts, and conclusion sections. E.E. wrote code that performed data preprocessing steps like train-test split, compared basic lasso and ridge regression models, and created LaTeX tables. C.S. developed and analyzed the visualizations of model performance and hyperparameter tuning, and implemented standardized feature scaling. Both authors helped with hyperparameter tuning and generic model development. Both authors proofread the entire document and all code written.
